# Section 3: 10 LangGraph Tiny Projects

This section contains 10 tiny LangGraph projects, each under 20 lines of code, designed specifically for beginners and undergraduate students.

## 🛠 Project List
1.  **[Simple State](./01_simple_state.py)**: Defining a state dictionary.
2.  **[Single Node](./02_single_node.py)**: A graph with one node.
3.  **[Two Nodes](./03_two_nodes.py)**: Simple linear flow.
4.  **[Conditional Edge](./04_conditional_edge.py)**: Basic routing logic.
5.  **[Cycle](./05_cycle.py)**: Repeating nodes based on state.
6.  **[Persistence](./06_persistence.py)**: Using MemorySaver for history.
7.  **[Parallel Execution](./07_parallel_execution.py)**: Running nodes in parallel.
8.  **[Human Interrupt](./08_human_interrupt.py)**: Pausing for human input.
