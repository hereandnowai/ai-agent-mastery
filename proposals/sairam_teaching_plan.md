# Teaching & Impact Plan: AI Agent Fast-Track
**Institution:** Sairam Institute of Technology  
**Program Duration:** 12 Hours (2 Days x 6 Hours)  
**Trainer Profile:** [HERE AND NOW AI](https://hereandnowai.com)  
**Slogan:** AI is Good

## 🎯 Executive Summary for Sairam SIT
This 12-hour intensive track is a distilled version of the "AI Agent Mastery" course, specifically engineered to move students from **LLM literacy** to **Agentic Engineering**. By focusing on the first three modules (Intro, LangChain, and LangGraph), we ensure students master the logic of autonomy before venturing into complex multi-agent swarms.

## 🛠 Teaching Strategy (The "Impact" Methodology)

1. **The "20-Line" Rule**: Every project shown to Sairam students is under 20 lines of code. This reduces "syntax anxiety" and focuses on **Architectural Logic**.
2. **Predict-Observe-Correct**: Before running each script (e.g., `05_cycle.py`), the class predicts the graph's path, observes the terminal output, and discusses the state transitions.
3. **Template-First Development**: Students start with the pre-configured `.venv` and `requirements.txt` to ensure 100% of their time is spent on code logic, not environment debugging.

## 🚀 Key Impact Milestones for Students

- **Hour 3**: First LLM call using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
- **Hour 6**: First functional agent capable of searching the web and summarizing results.
- **Hour 9**: Understanding the concept of "Checkpointing" and why it matters for enterprise AI.
- **Hour 12**: Successfully building a graph that asks for user permission before executing a task.

## 🎓 Evaluation & Certification
To receive the "HERE AND NOW AI" certificate for this fast-track, students must:
1. Fork the `ai-agent-mastery` repository.
2. Complete all 20 "Tiny Projects" in their own GitHub workspace.
3. Successfully explain the difference between a `Chain` and a `StateGraph`.
