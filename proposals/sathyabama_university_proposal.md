## 1. Program Vision
The "AI Agent Mastery" workshop is an accelerated, high-impact training track designed to transition students from passive LLM users to active **Agentic Architects**. By focusing on the industry's most powerful frameworks—LangChain and LangGraph—we provide students at Sathyabama University with the exact tools used by elite AI labs globally to build autonomous workflows and collaborative agent swarms.

## 3. Curriculum Deep-Dive

### Module 1: The Reasoning Loop
We dissect the "Brain" of an agent. Students will build raw Python loops to understand how planning, execution, and observation create autonomy.

### Module 2: Tool Integration (LangChain)
Building a suite of 10 specialized agents. Students learn to ground LLMs in reality by connecting them to Google Search, SQL Databases, and Python Interpreters.

### Module 3: State Management (LangGraph)
Beyond linear chains. We teach students how to build graphs that can "think" iteratively, "loop" through problems, and "wait" for human approval on high-stakes tasks.

### Module 4: Multi-Agent Capstone
The program concludes with a massive project where 5+ specialized agents (Supervisor, Researcher, Analyst, Auditor) work together to generate complex market reports.
