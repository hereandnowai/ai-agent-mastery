## 1. Executive Summary
In an era where static AI models are rapidly evolving into autonomous entities, the ability to build and manage **AI Agents** is becoming a critical skill for the next generation of software engineers. This 30-hour certification program, curated and delivered by **HERE AND NOW AI**, bridges the gap between traditional LLM usage and the development of intelligent, self-reasoning systems. Students will progress from foundational concepts to building a fully autonomous multi-agent swarm, ready for industry application.

## 2. Program Objectives
- **Mastery of Reasoning Loops:** Moving beyond simple prompts to autonomous ReAct cycles.
- **Framework Proficiency:** Hands-on experience with LangChain and LangGraph.
- **Stateful Engineering:** Learning to manage complex conversation states and long-term memory.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Designing teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve massive tasks.
